<p>
	bootstrap-vz is a bootstrapping framework for Debian specifically targeted at virtualized environments.
	It runs without any user intervention and generates a ready-to-boot image for
	<a href="providers.html">a number of virtualization platforms</a>.
	Its aim is to provide a reproducable bootstrapping process using <a href="manifest.html">manifests</a>
	as well as supporting a high degree of customizability through plugins.
</p>

<p>
	<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
	bootstrap-vz has a number of dependencies depending on the target platform and
	<a href="plugins.html">the selected plugins</a>.
	At a bare minimum the following python libraries are needed:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor">termcolor</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fysom">fysom</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsonschema">jsonschema</a></li>
	</ul>
	To bootstrap Debian itself <a href="https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/debootstrap">debootstrap</a>
	is needed as well.<br/>
	Any other requirements are dependent upon the manifest configuration and are detailed in the corresponding
	sections of the documentation.
	bootstrap-vz will however warn you if a requirement has not been met, before the bootstrapping process begins.
